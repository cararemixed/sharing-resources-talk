# Presentation Sandbox

The following project was set up to show and run various code examples
at an Elixir NYC meetup. If you'd like to know more, feel free to open
an issue or reach out to me.

Not much has been touched from the default mix application layout. There
is elixir code in `lib` and some "equivalent" code to compare in Erlang
under `src`. Not everything has idiomatic translations so there are
cases which have minor differences which were pointed out during the talk.
